        The <b>Passenger Importance Factor</b> is a means of quantifying the financial worth and importance of the passenger to the airline.
        The model uses this factor to introduce future value as a priority for allocating the most convenient solutions to passengers
        where it would most benefit airline future revenue (subject to other factors such as vulnerability).
        <br>
        This factor is the weighted summation of:
        <ul>
          <li>Fare Class;</li>
          <li>Frequent Flyer Status (with Qantas or the Oneworld Alliance); and</li>
          <li>Participation in other Qantas loyalty programs (eg. Points Club and branded credit cards).</li>

        The <b>Trip-Specific Inconvenience Factor</b> quantifies the inconvenience that a passenger experiences from being allocated
        to a specific reaccommodation. The relevant components of this factor include passenger preferences, the weighted sum of inconveniences
        associated with the reaccommodation, and the passenger's vulnerability variation.
        <hr>
        <b>Passenger Preferences</b>
        <br>
        If the passenger has nominated this reaccommodation as one of their preferred options (using the passenger preference form),
        the trip-specific inconvenience associated with this reaccommodation is 0, regardless of Qantas' subjective evaluation of this
        inconvenience.

        <hr>
        <b>Weighted Sum of Inconveniences</b>
        <br>
        For each reaccommodation, the following inconveniences are considered:
        <ul>
          <li>Whether the reaccommodation requires a long wait in an airport;</li>
          <li>Whether the reaccommodation requires that the passenger leaves the airport;</li>
          <li>Whether the reaccommodation requires that the passenger clears immigration in the country of disruption;</li>
          <li>Whether the reaccommodation requires that the passenger reclaims their checked baggage; and</li>
          <li>Whether the city/country of disruption is one that the passenger is familiar with.</li>
        </ul>

        Each of these inconveniences matters differently depending on the type of passenger. For example, a family travelling with
        small children may prefer the comfort of a hotel room compared to long waits in an airport, while a passenger with a serious
        medical condition ought remain close to medical attention and airline staff as much as possible. To accommodate these priorities,
        each of the inconveniences is differently weighted depending on the vulnerability variation of the passenger (see 'vulnerability variation'),
        and the Kano Model of Customer Satisfaction. Under the Kano model, each inconvenience is categorised as either:

        <ul>
          <li><b>Must-Be</b> - Inconveniences in this category severely impact the passenger.</li>
          <li><b>One-Dimensional</b> - Inconveniences in this category do not incur a uniquely significant harm, beyond the base level of inconvenience.</li>
          <li><b>Attractive</b> - The passenger is notionally indifferent to this inconvenience.</li>
        </ul>

         Using the Kano model, the inconvenience of the solution, as weighted for the passenger type, is calculated.

        <hr>
        <b>Vulnerability Variation</b>
        The vulnerability variation of the passenger categorises a passenger as 'vulnerable' if they:
        <ul>
          <li>Are travelling with small children;</li>
          <li>Are elderly or requiring special handling;</li>
          <li>Have a serious medical condition;</li>
          <li>Are an unaccompanied minor.</li>
        </ul>

        These vulnerability variations serve two purposes; not only do they form the basis of the Kano-model-based weighting of inconveniences,
        but if a passenger meets one of the above criteria, then the trip-specific inconvenience factor <i>regardless</i> of the reaccommodation is
        augmented, because the airline ought prioritise these types of passengers.
