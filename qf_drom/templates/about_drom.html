      <h4 class="card-text">How can we provide better, most cost-efficient solutions to customers facing disruption?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      The issue of managing customer disruption is one of the biggest opportunities that face the airline industry today.
      An airline which is able to optimise costs of recovering customers, both from their perspective and their passengers',
      stands to benefit significantly by:
      <ul>
        <li>Reducing the direct cost that the airline expends directly to manage passengers;</li>
        <li>Considering, and therefore reducing, the opportunity cost of allocating passengers to solutions; and</li>
        <li>Factoring passenger convenience, which increases satisfaction and encourages future loyalty to the brand.</li>
      </ul>

      The airline industry has, in recent time, struggled with innovating on this front, primarily given the unpredictable nature of disruption events.
      Disruptions tend to be the product of either:

      <ul>
        <li><b>Macro Factors</b>, which affect groups of flights at at time (eg. aircraft defects and industrial action); or</li>
        <li><b>Micro Factors</b>, which affect single flights at a time (eg. Air Traffic Control delays) but which can have knock-on effects for other
          flights which use the same aircraft or passengers.</li>
      </ul>

      Currently, to reaccomodate passengers, airlines either rebook all passengers on the same solution, which creates a missed opportunity to
      more quickly and efficiently reaccommodate high-priority passengers, or they engage in review and rebooking on a passenger-by-passenger basis. This process
      is resource-intensive and greedy; it only considers what is best for that individual customer, and doesn't consider the opportunity cost of allocating customers in a certain way.

        <h4 class="card-text">What are the results of our research?</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
        The <b>Disruption Recovery Optimisation Model</b> (DROM) is based on Linear Programming (a method of artificial-intelligence-based decision science).
        Given a list of disrupted passenger units, and a list of potential reaccommodations available to the airline, the DROM is designed to produce an optimal
        allocation of passengers to reaccommodations, in a way which minimises the overall cost of the reaccommodation. The DROM model also includes an <b>automatic passenger
          notification system</b> (APNS), which can redirect them to a personalised form that they can use to nominate their preferred method of reaccommodation.

        <br>Practically, the workflow of this model is as follows:
        <ol>
          <li>Qantas identifies that a disruption event is in progress/has occurred, and isolates a list of passengers which have been disrupted.</li>
          <li>Qantas identifies possible reaccommodations for passengers that have been disrupted, and compiles these into a list.</li>
          <li>Qantas uploads the lists from (1) and (2) into the DROM.</li>
          <li>The DROM's APNS contacts passengers, and asks them to complete a preference form located on their personalised page.</li>
          <li>The DROM uses the information provided by Qantas, the information provided by the passengers, and our <b>cost function</b> to evaluate the cost of allocating
          a passenger to each possible solution.</li>
          <li>The DROM uses the Hungarian algorithm to select the combination of allocations which minimises the overall cost of all reaccommodations, as defined by the cost function.</li>
          <li>The DROM outputs the final list of allocations to Qantas.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4 class="card-text">What is cost?</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
        As we flagged above, the notion of <b>cost</b> has been traditionally restricted to the direct cost that Qantas incurs as a result of a reaccommodation.
        This belies the true 'cost' of reaccommodation, which should include the inconvenience experienced by passengers (which, in turn, is a proxy for their likelihood
        to engage with the airline in the future). To overcome this barrier, the DROM is assessed using a cost function, which combines:
        <ul>
          <li>The importance of the passenger (measured by fare class, frequent flyer status and other engagement with Qantas loyalty brands);</li>
          <li>The inconvenience of the reaccommodation from the passenger's perspective, augmented by factors which make that passenger more vulnerable than others (eg.
            if the passenger has a serious medical condition or is an unaccompanied minor); and</li>
          <li>Costs to Qantas of providing the solution.</li>
        </ul>
